<h3>ST. STEPHEN'S DAY AND RILEY'S HOVEDEN.</h3>

  <p>In Roger de Hoveden's account of the accident which proved fatal to
  Leopold, Duke of Austria, the jailer of Richard I. (Bohn's edit., vol.
  ii. p.&nbsp;345.), St. Stephen's Day, on which it occurred, is twice stated to
  be <i>before</i> Christmas Day, instead of after it. Is this an error of
  the author, or of translator?<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> or are they right, and was St.
  Stephen's martyrdom in those times commemorated on a different day from
  what it now is? I cannot find, on reference to the authorities within my
  reach, that this last was the case. Mr. Riley does not notice the
  discrepancy at all.</p>

  <p>In the translation of this Volume, a few errors have come under my
  observation, to which I beg to call Mr. R.'s attention: 1. In his note on
  Corumphira's prophecy, at p.&nbsp;36., he seems to forget that the Mahometan
  year differs from the Julian by eleven or twelve days, and that in
  consequence <span class="scac">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1186 does not correspond to
  <span class="scac">A.&nbsp;H.</span> 564; in fact, the old astrologer is
  perfectly correct in his chronology, more so than in his predictions,
  many of which were signally falsified in the course of the next few
  years. 2. A mountain frequently mentioned by his author as projecting
  into the sea at the boundary of Catalonia and Valencia, and called
  "Muncian," he says in a note at p.&nbsp;151. is "probably Montserrat," which
  is far from either the sea or the frontier; the maps of Spain all show,
  near the town of Vinaros on the east coast, a hill on the sea-shore
  called "Monte Sia," which still, as then, forms the boundary in that
  direction between the two provinces. 3. In his note at p.&nbsp;156. on "Mount
  Gebel," the translator says, "he (the author) probably means Stromboli;"
  surely the name of Mongibello, and the mention of Catania a few lines
  farther down should have shown him that Etna only could be meant,
  although part of the mistake is due to Hoveden himself, who talks of it
  as a separate island from Sicily. Mr. Riley's other geographical notes
  are generally <!-- Page 638 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page638"></a>{638}</span>correct, though a little more pains might
  have greatly increased their number, to the elucidation of his author's
  account of the Crusaders' proceedings in the East. 4. At p.&nbsp;249. a
  well-known passage from Horace is ascribed to Juvenal.</p>

<h3>THE HOLY TRINITY CHURCH, HULL.</h3>

  <p>There is an error in the heading of one of the architectural notes
  appended to the <i>Proceedings of the Arch. Inst.</i> held at York in
  1846. From the description which is given (p.&nbsp;38.), it is plain that the
  above church is the one to which the note refers; not that of St. Mary's,
  which is the title of the article.</p>

  <p>The material of the whole church is not, also, "brick with stone
  dressings," as the note informs us, only the chancel, south porch, and
  south transept; all the rest is of stone, and in a very sad state of
  repair. A few years ago, the south transept was restored; but the
  ornamental part was worked in such bad stone, that the crockets of the
  pinnacles have already begun to moulder away. It is a curious fact, that
  Bishop Lyttleton, who visited Hull in 1756 for the express purpose of
  "examining the walls of the town, and the materials of which the Holy
  Trinity Church is constructed," should have stated in the
  <i>Archæologia</i> (vol. i. p.&nbsp;146.) that there did not appear to be
  "<i>a single brick</i> in or about the whole fabric, except a few in the
  south porch, placed there of late years."</p>

  <p>There is a matter of great archæological interest connected with the
  part of the church which is built of brick; for, as there is reason to
  believe that the chancel was raised in the year 1285, there is good
  foundation for the supposition, that Hull was "the first town to restore
  in this country the useful art of brickmaking" (Frost's <i>Hull</i>,
  p.&nbsp;138.). The walls of the town, which were erected by royal licence in
  1322, and still standing with their gates and towers in the time of
  Leland and Camden, are described by them as being of brick. Leland also
  says (<i>Itin.</i>, edit. Hearne, fol. 53.) that the greater part of the
  "houses of the town at that tyme (Richard II.) was made al of brike."</p>

  <p><i>Italian-English</i> (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;436.).&mdash;The following

  <p>The name was borne by a very respectable man, who, in the year 1801,
  was in partnership with his brother Remus Riggs, as a broker in
  Georgetown, in the district of Columbia. Romulus, who survived his

  <p><i>Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</i>&mdash;The immense loss
  sustained by France in all her great interests, as affecting her civil
  and religious liberties, her commerce, trade, arts, sciences, not to
  speak of the unutterable anguish inflicted upon hundred of thousands of
  individuals (among whom were the writer's maternal ancestors,&mdash;their
  name, Courage), by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, has lately
  called into action the pens of some industrious and talented men of
  letters, among whom M. Weiss is one of the most meritorious. His
  interesting work, I observe, is about to receive an English dress. In the
  shape of a Note through your medium, in order that the translator may
  avail himself of information which, possibly, may not have reached him,
  it should be known that Mr. William Jones, one of the highly respected
  and accomplished <i>employés</i> of the British Museum, has written a
  letter to the <i>Journal des Débats</i> (inserted in its number of Nov.
  30, and signed with his name), containing farther information of a
  painfully-absorbing nature, from documents in the Museum, respecting the
  <i>dragonnades</i>, and the sufferings and persecutions of a French
  pastor.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF SILO.</h3>

  <p>Can you or any of your correspondents inform me what is the derivation
  of the word <i>silo</i>?</p>

  <p>For many years after the colony of New South Wales was founded, it was
  almost wholly dependent upon the mother country for such supplies of
  grain, &amp;c. as were necessary for the life and health of its
  inhabitants; and, consequently, store ships were regularly despatched
  from our shores to Sydney.</p>

  <p>It happened however that, in consequence of wrecks and other
  disasters, the colonists were, on more than one occasion, reduced to the
  greatest distress, and starvation almost began to stare them in the face.
  Under these circumstances, one of the early governors of Sydney, to
  prevent the recurrence of famine, gathered a large supply of corn and
  deposited it in granaries which he had excavated out of the solid rock at
  the head of the bay, near the mouth of the Paramatta River. These were
  termed <i>silos</i> or <i>siloes</i>: they were hermetically sealed up,
  and from time to time the old corn was exchanged for new.</p>

  <p>The supply of corn in these remarkable storehouses is still kept up;
  nor as late as the time of my departure from those colonies last year,
  did I hear of any intention of discontinuing this old custom.</p>

  <p>Now the termination of this word in <i>o</i> marks it as Spanish; and
  accordingly, on reference to Baretti's dictionary of that language, I
  find the word "<span class="sc">Silo</span>, a subterraneous granary."
  But, Sir, this discovery only raises another question, and one which I
  wish much to see solved. A Spanish substantive must be for the most part
  the name of something existing at some time or other in Spain.</p>

  <p><i>When</i>, therefore, did such granaries exist in Spain, <i>in what
  part</i> of the country, and <i>under what circumstances</i>?</p>

  desired in English), a manual giving a standard alphabet for the various
  kinds of writing now in use, viz. English hand, engrossing, Italian,

  sort of writing-master's key: and if so, what is its title, and where it

<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp.&nbsp;220. 395. 498.)</p>

  <p>When I mentioned the above subject in "N. &amp; Q.," I admit that my
  meaning may have taken too wide a signification. I, however, wrote
  advisedly, my object being to draw the attention of those schools that
  were in fault, and in the hope of benefiting those that desired to do
  more. I suppose I must exonerate Tonbridge, therefore, from any
  aspersion; and as it appears they are well provided, from Bacon and
  Newton to <i>Punch</i> and the <i>Family Friend</i>, I am at a loss to
  know how I can be of service.</p>

  <p>Of the defects in popular education I am as sensible as the rest of
  the multitude appear to be, and my particular view of the case would, I
  fear, be too lengthy a subject for these columns. It is quite clear,
  however, that education is partial, and in some sort a monopoly; its
  valuable branches being altogether out of the reach of more than half the
  population, and the staple industry of the people not sufficiently
  represented,&mdash;as, for instance, the steam-engine. In them there is
  not sufficient concentration, if I may use the term, of instruction; and
  the requirements of many arts and trades insufficiently carried out; the
  old schools and old colleges much too classical and mathematical. If this
  position is untrue, no popular scheme can be adopted at present; but it
  appears more than probable that before long the subject will be brought
  before the House of Commons, and education made accessible to all. As to
  the money for the purpose, the country will never grudge that. The
  obstacle appears to lie more in persuading the endless religious sects
  into which we are divided to shake hands over the matter.</p>

  <p>At present my only desire is, that boys at public schools should have
  plenty of books, being assured that reading while we are young leaves a
  very strong and permanent impression, and cannot be estimated too highly;
  besides which, if a youth has access to works suited to his natural bent,
  he will unconsciously lay in a store of valuable information adapted to
  his future career.</p>

  <p>When I was at the College school, Gloucester, in 1794, there was a
  considerable library in a room adjoining the upper school. I never knew
  the books used by the boys, though the room was unlocked: in fact, it was
  used by the upper master as a place of chastisement; for there was kept
  the block (as it was called) on which the unfortunate culprits were
  horsed and whipped. The library, no doubt, contained many valuable and
  excellent works; but the only book of which I know the name as having
  been in it (and that <!-- Page 641 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>TRENCH ON PROVERBS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp.&nbsp;387. 519.)</p>

  <p>The error, which Luther was the first to fall into, in departing from
  the anciently received version of Ps. cxxvii. 2., Mendelsohn adopted; but
  no translator of eminence has followed these two Hebraists; although some
  critics have been carried away by their authority to the proper Jewish
  notion of "gain," and not sleep, being the subject. Luther's
  version&mdash;"Denn seinen Freunden gibt er <i>es</i>
  schlafend"&mdash;was certainly before the revisers of our authorised
  version of James I.; but was rejected, I consider, as ungrammatical and
  false: <i>ungrammatical</i>, because the transitive verb "give"
  (<i>gibt</i>) has no accusative noun; and <i>false</i>, because he
  supplies, without authority, the place of the missing noun by the pronoun
  "it" (<i>es</i>), there being no antecedent to which this <i>it</i>
  refers. Mendelsohn omits the <i>it</i> in his Hebrew comment, supplied
  however unauthorisedly by <span class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span> in his
  translation of such comment. But Mendelsohn introduces the "<i>es</i>"
  (it), in his German version (Berlin, 1788, dedicated to Ramler), without
  however any authority from the Hebrew original of this Psalm. He is
  therefore at variance with himself. And, farther, he has omitted
  altogether the important word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KEIN"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5BC;&#x5B5;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  (<i>so</i> or <i>thus</i>), rendered "<i>denn</i>" (for) by Luther.</p>

  <p>As to the "unintelligible authorised version," I must premise that no
  version has yet had so large an amount of learning bestowed on it as the
  English one; indeed it has fairly beaten out of the field all the
  versions of all other sections of Christians. The difficulty of the
  English version arises from its close adherence to the oriental letter;
  but if we put the scope of this Psalm into the vernacular, such
  difficulty is eliminated.</p>

  <p>Solomon says, in this Psalm: "Without Jehovah's support, my house will
  fall: if He keep this city, the watch, with its early-risings,
  late-resting, and ill-feeding, is useless: <i>thus He</i> (by so keeping
  or watching the city himself) <i>gives sleep to him whom He loves</i>."
  The remainder of the Psalm refers to the increase of population as
  Jehovah's gift, wherein Solomon considers the strength of the city to
  consist. The words in Italics correspond precisely in sense with those of
  the authorised version&mdash;"<i>For</i> so He giveth His beloved sleep;"
  and the latter is supported fully by all the ancient versions, and, as
  far as I can at present ascertain, by all the best modern ones.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. J. Buckton.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Lichfield.</p>

  <p>What is there <i>unintelligible</i> in the authorised translation of
  Psalm cxxvii. 2., "He giveth His beloved sleep?" It is a literal
  translation of three very plain words, of the simplest grammatical
  construction, made in accordance with all the ancient versions. A
  difficulty there does indeed exist in the passage, viz. in the commencing
  word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;; but this word, though
  capable of many <i>intelligible</i> meanings, does not enter into the
  present question. Since the great majority of critics have been contented
  to see no objection to the received translations, it is perfectly
  allowable to maintain that the proposed rendering makes, instead of
  removing, a difficulty, and obscures a passage which, as generally
  understood, is sufficiently lucid. Hengstenberg's difficulty is, that the
  subject is not about the <i>sleep</i>, but the <i>gain</i>. But is not
  sleep a gain? Can we forget the <span title="hupnou dôron" class="grk"
  >&#x1F55;&pi;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &delta;&#x1FF6;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span> of Homer? that is, sufficient,
  undisturbed sleep, rest. Hengstenberg's remark, that all, even the
  beloved, must labour, is a mere truism. The Psalmist evidently opposes
  excessive and over-anxious labours, interfering with natural rest, to
  ordinary labour accompanied with refreshing sleep. The object of his
  censure is precisely the <span title="merimna" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F73;&rho;&iota;&mu;&nu;&alpha;</span> which forms the subject of
  our Lord's warning; who censures not due care and providence, but
  over-anxiety. Burkius rightly remarks, that <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="SHN'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  is antithetical to <i>surgere, sedere, dolorum</i>. Hammond observes,
  with far more clearness and good sense than Hengstenberg,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For as to the former of these, wicked men that incessantly moil, and
  cark, and drudge for the acquiring of it, and never enjoy any of the
  comforts of this life, through the vehement pursuit of riches, are
  generally frustrated and disappointed in their aims: whereas, on the
  contrary, those who have God's blessing thrive insensibly, become very
  prosperous, <i>and yet never lose any sleep in the pursuit of
  it</i>."</p>

  <p>Bishop Horne agrees; his remarks having evident reference to
  Hammond's. So Bishop <!-- Page 642 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page642"></a>{642}</span>Horsley, more briefly, but with his usual
  force: "You take all this trouble for your security in vain, whilst He
  gives His beloved sleep." Dr. French and Mr. Skinner adhere to the same
  sense in their translation, and pertinently refer to Psalms iii. and iv.,
  in which the Psalmist, though beset by enemies, lies down and takes his
  rest, defended by God his Keeper. So far, indeed, from seeing anything
  unintelligible, I see no obscurity, either of expression or connexion, in
  this view, but very great obscurity in the double ellipsis now proposed.
  In the received translation we have a transitive verb, and a noun,
  obviously its accusative, according to the natural sequence and simple
  construction of the Hebrew language. In the proposed rendering we must
  understand an accusative case after <i>giveth</i> (i.e. <i>bread</i>, as
  Rosenmüller and others observe), and a particle before <i>sleep</i>. The
  transitive verb has no subject; the noun nothing to govern it. We must
  guess at both.</p>

  <p>As for the alleged instances of ellipses, I maintain they are not
  analogous. I cannot call to mind any which are; and if any of your
  correspondents would show some they would do good service. Hengstenberg's
  examples of <span lang="he" class="heb" title="TSRB" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E6;&#x5E8;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="BQR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5E7;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, &amp;c. are surely
  not in point. We have a similar ellipsis, often used in idiomatic
  English, <i>morning</i>, <i>noon</i>, and <i>night</i>; but who would say
  <i>sleep</i>, instead of <i>in sleep</i>, or <i>while asleep</i>? The
  ellipses in the Psalms, in the Songs of Degrees themselves, are very
  numerous, but they are of a different nature; and neither the position
  nor the nature of the word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SHN'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E; warrants that now
  defended, as far I can remember.</p>

  <p>May I remark, by the way, that the Psalm falls rather into three
  strophes than into two. The first speaks of the raising up of the house,
  and of the city (an aggregation of houses), protected by the Almighty.
  The last is in parallelism to the first, though, as often happens,
  expanded; and speaks of the raising up of the family, and of the family
  arrived at maturity, the defenders of the city, through the same
  protecting Providence. The central portion is the main and cardinal
  sentiment, viz. the vanity of mere human labour, and the peace of those
  who are beloved of God.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John Jebb.</span></p>

  <p>There is a proverb which foretells peril to such as interpose in the
  quarrels of others. But as neither Mr. Trench, nor E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;B., nor <span
  class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span>, have as yet betrayed any disposition
  to quarrel about the question in dispute, a looker-on need not be afraid
  of interposing.</p>

  <p>The Query, about the solution of which they differ, is the proper mode
  of rendering the last clause of v.&nbsp;2. Ps.&nbsp;cxxvii. In our Liturgy and
  Bible it is rendered, "<i>For</i> so He giveth His beloved sleep;" of
  which E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;B. says, "It seems to me to be correct;" though he justly
  observes that "He will give" would be more close. Mr. Trench appears to
  have rendered it, "He giveth His beloved <i>in their</i> sleep." <span
  class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span> says "the words should be, He will give
  to His beloved <i>whilst he</i> [the beloved] <i>is</i> asleep." In each
  case the Italics, as usual, designate words not existing in the Hebrew
  text.</p>

  <p>When expositors would get through a difficult passage, their readers
  have, not unfrequently, the vexation of finding that a word of some
  importance has been ignored. Such has been the case here with the little
  word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, which introduces the
  clause. Its ordinary meaning is <i>so</i>; and the office of the word
  <i>so</i>, in such a position, is to lead the remind to revert to what
  has been previously said, as necessary to the proper application of what
  follows. Now, the Psalmist's theme was the vanity of all care and labour,
  unless the Lord both provide for and watch over His people; <i>for</i> so
  He will give His beloved sleep&mdash;that happy, confiding repose which
  the solicitude of the worldly cannot procure. This is, surely,
  intelligible enough and even if <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KN"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E; may be translated
  <i>for</i> (which Noldius, in his <i>Concordantia Particularum</i>,
  affirms that it here may, adducing however but one dubious instance of
  its being so used elsewhere, viz. Jeremiah xiv. 10.), or if the various
  reading, <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KY" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, be accepted, which would
  mean <i>for</i>, our version of the clause will be quite compatible with
  either alteration.</p>

  <p>In this concentrated proposition are contained, the mode of giving,
  <i>so</i>; the character of the recipient, <i>his beloved</i>; and we
  reasonably expect to be next told what the Lord will give, and the text
  accordingly proceeds to say, <i>sleep</i>. Whereas, if either Mr.
  Trench's or <span class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span>'s version of the
  clause could properly be accepted, the gift would remain entirely
  unmentioned; after attention had been called to the giver, to his mode of
  giving, and to the recipient who might expect his bounty. But whilst Mr.
  Trench is constrained to interpolate <i>in their</i>, apparently
  unconscious that the Hebrew requires <i>beloved</i> to be in the singular
  number, <span class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span> translates <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="SHN'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E; as if it were
  a participle, which Luther seems also to have heedlessly done. Yet unless
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SHN'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E; be a noun,
  derived with a little irregularity from <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="YSHN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, <i>he
  slept</i>, it has nothing to do with sleep. It cannot be the participle
  of <span lang="he" class="heb" title="YSHN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, for that
  verb has a participle in the usual form, not wanting the initial <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="Y" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, which occurs in several places in
  the Old Testament, and is used by Mendelsohn in the very sentence <span
  class="sc">Mr. Margoliouth</span> has quoted from that Jewish expositor.
  The critic who will not acknowledge <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="SHN'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E; to be a noun
  in this clause, is therefore tied up to translating it as either the
  participle or the preterite of <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SHN'"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, <i>to
  change</i>, or <i>to repeal</i>, and would thus make the clause really
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p>N. B. inquires, whether the translation of Psalm cxxvii. 2. adopted by
  Mr. Trench has the sanction of any version but that of Luther. I beg
  leave to inform him that the passage was translated in the same manner by
  Coverdale: "For look, to whom it pleaseth Him He giveth it in sleep." De
  Wette also, in modern times, has "Giebt er seinen Geliebten im
  Schlafe."</p>

  <p>Vatablus, in his Annotations, approves of such a rendering: "Dabit in
  somno dilectis suis." It has also been suggested in the notes of several
  modern critics.</p>

  <p>Not one of the ancient versions sanctions this translation.</p>

  <p>The sense of the passage will be much the same whichever of these
  translations be adopted. But the common rendering appears to me to
  harmonise best with the preceding portion of it.</p>

<h3>MAJOR ANDRÉ.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 174. 604.)</p>

  <p>The following extracts and cuttings from newspapers, relative to the
  unfortunate Major André, may interest your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Serviens</span>. I believe I have some others, which I will
  send when I can lay my hand upon them. I inclose a pencil copy of the
  scarce print of a sketch from a pen-and-ink drawing, made by André
  himself on Oct. 1, 1780, of his crossing the river when he was taken:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Visit to the Grave of André.</i>&mdash;We stopped at Piermont, on
  the widest part of Tappan Bay, where the Hudson extends itself to the
  width of three miles. On the opposite side, in full view from the hotel,
  is Tarrytown, where poor André was captured. Tradition says that a very
  large white-wood tree, under which he was taken, was struck by lightning
  on the very day that news of André's death was received at Tarrytown. As
  I sat gazing on the opposite woods, dark in the shadows of moonlight, I
  thought upon how very slight a circumstance often depends the fate of
  individuals and the destiny of nations. In the autumn of 1780, a farmer
  chanced to be making cider at a mill on the east bank of the Hudson, near
  that part of Haverstraw Bay called 'Mother's Lap.' Two young men,
  carrying muskets, as usual in those troubled times, stopped for a draught
  of sweet cider, and seated themselves on a log to wait for it. The farmer
  found them looking very intently on some distant object, and inquired
  what they saw. 'Hush, hush!' they replied; 'the red coats are yonder,
  just within the Lap,' pointing to an English gun-boat, with twenty-four
  men, lying on their oars. Behind the shelter of a rock, they fired into
  the boat, and killed two persons. The British returned a random shot; but
  ignorant of the number of their opponents, and seeing that it was useless
  to waste ammunition on a hidden foe, they returned whence they came with
  all possible speed. This boat had been sent to convey Major André to the
  British sloop-of-war Vulture, then lying at anchor off Teller's Point.
  Shortly after André arrived, and finding the boat gone, he, in attempting
  to pass through the interior, was captured. Had not those men stopped to
  drink sweet cider, it is probable that André would not have been hung;
  the American revolution might have terminated in quite a different
  fashion; men now deified as heroes might have been handed down to
  posterity as traitors; our citizens might be proud of claiming descent
  from Tories, and slavery have been abolished eight years ago, by virtue
  of our being British Colonies. So much may depend on a draught of cider!
  But would England herself have abolished slavery had it not been for the
  impulse given to free principles by the American revolution? Probably
  not. It is not easy to calculate the consequences involved even in a
  draught of cider, for no fact stands alone; each has infinite relations.
  A very pleasant ride at sunset brought us to Orange Town, to the lone
  field where Major André was executed. It is planted with potatoes, but
  the plough spares the spot on which was once his gallows and his grave. A
  rude heap of stones, with the remains of a dead fir tree in the midst,
  are all that mark it; but tree and stones are covered with names. It is
  on an eminence commanding a view of the country for miles. I gazed on the
  surrounding woods, and remembered that on this selfsame spot, the
  beautiful and accomplished young man walked back and forth, a few minutes
  preceding his execution, taking an earnest farewell look of earth and
  sky. My heart was sad within me. Our guide pointed to a house in full
  view, at half a mile's distance, which he told us was at that time the
  head-quarters of General Washington. I turned my back suddenly upon it.
  The last place on earth where I would wish to think of Washington is at
  the grave of André. I know that military men not only sanction but
  applaud the deed; and, reasoning according to the maxims of war, I am
  well aware how much can be said in his defence. That Washington
  considered it a duty, the discharge of which was most painful to him, I
  doubt not. But, thank God, the instincts of any childhood are unvitiated
  by any such maxims. From the first hour I read of the deed, until the
  present day, I never did, and never could, look upon it as otherwise than
  cool, deliberate murder. That the theory and practice of war commends the
  transaction, only serves to prove the infernal nature of war itself.... A
  few years ago, the Duke of York requested the British Consul to send the
  remains of Major André to England. At that time two thriving firs were
  found near the grave, and a peach-tree; which a lady in the neighbourhood
  had planted there, in the kindness of her heart. The farmers who came to
  witness the interesting ceremony generally evinced the most respectful
  tenderness for the memory of the unfortunate dead, and many of the
  children wept. A few idlers, educated by militia trainings and Fourth of
  July declaration, began to murmur that the memory of General Washington
  was insulted by any respect shown to the remains of André; but the offer
  of a treat lured them to the tavern, where they soon became too drunk to
  guard the character of Washington. It was a beautiful day, and these
  disturbing spirits being removed, the impressive ceremony proceeded in
  solemn silence. <!-- Page 644 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page644"></a>{644}</span>The coffin was in good preservation, and
  contained all the bones, with a small quantity of dust. The roots of the
  peach-tree had entirely interwoven the skull with their fine network. His
  hair, so much praised for its uncommon beauty, was tied, on the day of
  his execution, according to the fashion of the times. When his grave was
  opened, half a century afterwards, the riband was found in perfect
  preservation, and sent to his sister in England. When it was known that
  the sarcophagus containing his remains had arrived in New York, for
  London, many ladies sent garlands and emblematic devices, to be wreathed
  around it, in memory of the 'beloved and lamented André.' In their
  compassionate hearts, the teachings of nature were unperverted by maxims
  of war, or that selfish jealousy which dignifies itself with the name of
  patriotism. Blessed be God, that custom forbids women to electioneer or
  fight. May the sentiment remain till war and politics have passed away!
  Had not women and children been kept free from their polluting influence,
  the medium of communication between earth and heaven would have been
  completely cut off. At the foot of the eminence where the gallows had
  been erected, we found an old Dutch farm-house, occupied by a man who
  witnessed the execution, and whose father often sold peaches to the
  unhappy prisoner. He confirmed the account of André's uncommon personal
  beauty, and had a vivid remembrance of the pale but calm heroism with
  which he met his untimely death."&mdash;From Miss Child's <i>Letters from
  New York</i>.</p>

  <p>"<i>André.</i>&mdash;At the little town of Tappan, the unfortunate
  Major André, condemned by the council of war as a spy, was executed and
  buried. His remains were disinterred a few years ago, by order of the
  English Government, carried to England, and, if I mistake not, deposited
  in Westminster Abbey; whilst the remains of General Frazer, who fell like
  a hero, at the head of the King's troops, lie without a monument in the
  old redoubt near Still Water. The tree that grew over André's grave was
  likewise sent to England; and, as I was told, planted in the King's
  Garden, behind Carlton Palace."&mdash;Duke of Weimar's
  <i>Travels</i>.</p>

  <p>"<i>Disinterment of Major André</i>.&mdash;This event took place at
  Tappan on Friday, 10th inst., at one p.&nbsp;m., amidst a considerable
  concourse of ladies and gentlemen that assembled to witness this
  interesting ceremony. The British Consul, with several gentlemen,
  accompanied by the proprietor of the ground and his labourers, commenced
  their operations at eleven o'clock, by removing the heap of loose stones
  that surrounded and partly covered the grave. Great caution was observed
  in taking up a small peach-tree that was growing out of the grave, as the
  Consul stated his intention of sending it to his Majesty, to be placed in
  one of the Royal Gardens. Considerable anxiety was felt lest the coffin
  could not be found, as various rumours existed of its having been removed
  many years ago. However, when at the depth of three feet, the labourers
  came to it. The lid was broken in the centre, and had partly fallen in,
  but was kept up by resting on the skull. The lid being raised, the
  skeleton of the brave André appeared entire; bone to bone, each in its
  place, without a vestige of any other part of his remains, save some of
  his hair, which appeared in small tufts; and the only part of his dress
  was the leather string which tied it.</p>

  <p>"As soon as the curiosity of the spectators was gratified, a large
  circle was formed; when Mr. Eggleso, the undertaker, with his assistants,
  uncovered the sarcophagus, into which the remains were carefully removed.
  This superb depository, in imitation of those used in Europe for the
  remains of the illustrious dead, was made by Mr. Eggleso, of Broadway, of
  mahogany; the pannels covered with rich crimson velvet, surrounded by a
  gold bordering; the rings of deep burnished gold; the pannel also crimson
  velvet, edged with gold; the inside lined with black velvet; the whole
  supported by four gilt balls.</p>

  <p>"The sarcophagus, with the remains, has been removed on board his
  Majesty's packet; where, it is understood, as soon as some repairs on
  board are completed, an opportunity will be afforded of viewing
  it."&mdash;From the <i>New York Evening Post</i> of Aug. 11.</p>

  <p>"The remains of the lamented Major André have (as our readers already
  know) been lately removed from the spot where they were originally
  interred in the year 1780, at Tappan, New York, and brought to England in
  the Phæton frigate by order of his Royal Highness the Duke of York.
  Yesterday the sarcophagus was deposited in front of the cenotaph in
  Westminster Abbey, which was erected by his late Majesty to the memory of
  this gallant officer. The reinterment took place in the most private
  manner, the Dean of Westminster superintending in person, Major-Gen. Sir
  Herbert Taylor attending on the part of his Royal Highness the
  Commander-in-Chief and Mr. Locker, Secretary to Greenwich Hospital, on
  behalf of the three surviving sisters of the deceased."&mdash;From
  newspaper of which the name and date have not been preserved.</p>

  form. Can none of your readers inform me whether there do not remain

  means access could be had thereto? Are there none such in the British

  <p>Major André occupied Dr. Franklin's house when the British army was in
  Philadelphia in 1777 and 1778. When it evacuated the city, André carried
  off with him a portrait of the Doctor, which has never been heard of
  since. The British officers amused themselves with amateur theatricals at
  the South Street Theatre in Southwark, then the only one in Philadelphia,
  theatres being prohibited in the city. The tradition here is, that André
  painted the scenes. They were <!-- Page 645 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>PASSAGE IN WHISTON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 244. 397.)</p>

  <p>The book for which J.T. inquires is:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Important Doctrines of Original Sin, Justification by Faith and
  Regeneration, clearly stated from Scripture and Reason, and vindicated
  from the Doctrines of the Methodists; with Remarks on Mr. Law's late
  Tract on New Birth. By <i>Thomas</i> Whiston, A.B. Printed for John
  Whiston, at the Boyle's Head, Fleet Street. Pp.&nbsp;70."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not know who the author was. Perhaps a son of the celebrated
  <i>William</i> Whiston, six of whose works are advertised on the back of
  the title-page; and whose <i>Memoirs</i>, Lond. 1749, are "sold by Mr.
  Whiston in Fleet Street." If the passage cited by J.&nbsp;T. is all that
  Taylor says of Thomas Whiston, it conveys an erroneous notion of his
  pamphlet, which from pp.&nbsp;49. to 70. is occupied by the question of
  regeneration. I think his doctrine may be shortly stated thus:
  Regeneration accompanies the baptism of adults, and follows that of
  infants. In the latter case, the time is uncertain; but the fact is
  ascertainable by the recipients becoming spiritually minded.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I cannot dismiss this subject without observing <i>another sense of
  regeneration</i> in the Gospel. However, <i>this makes no alteration in
  the doctrine I have before established</i>; because, with us,
  regeneration and new birth are terms that bear the same exact meaning.
  What I before delivered of the spiritual new birth or regeneration is
  strictly true, though the word regeneration <i>is sometimes used in
  another sense</i>. It is not to be there understood of a spiritual or
  figurative birth, but of a literal and actual revival of the body from
  corruption. But <i>this is not that new birth we have before inquired
  after</i>, but only the assured and certain consequence of our preserving
  ourselves to the end in that spiritual state or birth we have entered
  into in this world. That I do not represent the sense of the word
  regeneration unfairly, may be gathered from Matt. xix. 28., rightly
  pointed and distinguished:</p>

  <p>"'And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye which have
  followed me (in the <i>regeneration</i>, when the Son of Man shall sit
  upon the throne of his glory), ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
  judging the twelve tribes of Israel.' Here regeneration <i>is not to be
  understood in the same sense as the new birth or regeneration mentioned
  by our Saviour</i> (John iii.), from whence the new birth is to be
  derived and stated; but, as I before observed, must be referred to a
  literal restoration to life, <i>i.&nbsp;e</i>. either to the general
  resurrection, or rather to the Millennium, when Christ is to reign upon
  earth over the Saints for a thousand years, after the dissolution of the
  present form of it. I make no doubt that this latter opinion is the
  genuine sense of the text I have quoted from St. Matthew; and
  consequently, that regeneration, <i>in this passage</i>, is to be applied
  to the first resurrection of the dead, or to the supposed
  Millennium."&mdash;Pp.&nbsp;67, 68.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above will show that Thomas Whiston did not "<i>maintain</i> that
  regeneration is a literal and physical being born again," in the sense
  which the passage quoted by J.&nbsp;T. conveys. I have not seen Taylor's work
  with the date 1746. As the name is common, and the pamphlets and sermons
  of that time on original sin are innumerable, many Taylors may have
  written besides the one mentioned by <span title="Halieus" class="grk"
  >&#x1F09;&lambda;&iota;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span>. J.&nbsp;T.'s Taylor
  cannot be excused even on the ground of having read only a part of the
  book he misrepresented: for he refers to p.&nbsp;68., from which he must have
  seen that Thomas Whiston there explained only an isolated passage.</p>

<h3>HELMETS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 538.)</p>

  <p>The following observations upon the helmet, by Stephen Martin Leake,
  Esq., Garter, may be acceptable to your querist S.&nbsp;N.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The helmet, called <i>galea</i> by the Greeks, <i>cassis</i> by the
  Romans, is called <i>helm</i> (which signifies the head) by the Germans;
  whence the French <i>heaume</i>, and our <i>helmet</i>. It is of great
  account with the Germans: the helm and crest deriving their use from
  tournaments, whence arms took their origin; and this being with them the
  most essential mark of noblesse, neither the Germans nor French allow a
  new made gentleman to bear a helmet, but only a wreath of his colours;
  and when he is a gentleman of three descents, to bear a helmet with three
  barrs for his three descents (Menestrier, <i>Abrégé méthodique des
  Armoiries</i>, 1672, p.&nbsp;28.; <i>Origine des Ornemens des Armoiries</i>,
  p.&nbsp;2.). <i>Tymbre</i> is the general word used for the casque or helm by
  the French. Menestrier, in his <i>Origine des Ornemens des Armoiries</i>,
  p.&nbsp;13., says the modern heralds observe three things with regard to the
  <i>tymbre</i>: the matter, the form, and the situation. That kings should
  have their helmets of gold open, and in full front; princes and lords of
  silver, and somewhat turned with a certain number of barrs, according to
  their degree; gentlemen to have their helmets of steel, and in profile.
  Colombiere assigns a knight a helmet bordered with silver, barons with
  gold, counts and viscounts the like, and the barrs gold; marquisses the
  helm same, and damasked with gold; dukes and princes the gold helmet,
  damasked. And as to the barrs, new gentlemen without any; gentlemen of
  three descents, three barrs; knights and ancient gentlemen, five; barons
  seven; counts and viscounts nine; marquisses eleven. But Moreau, who
  first propagated these inventions (<i>Origine des Ornemens des
  Armoiries</i>, p.&nbsp;17.), assigns to an emperor or king eleven, a prince or
  duke nine, a marquis and count seven, a baron five: whence it seems there
  is no <!-- Page 646 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page646"></a>{646}</span>certain rule or uniform practice observed
  herein, unless in the situation of the helmet, wherein both the Germans
  and French account it more noble to bear an open helmet than a close one;
  but these are novel distinctions. Anciently, the helmets were all turned
  to the right, and close; and it is but some years since, says Menestrier
  (<i>Abrégé Méthodique</i>, 1672, p.&nbsp;28.), that they began to observe the
  number of grilles or barrs, to distinguish the different degrees. But
  however ingenious these inventions are, it is certain that they are
  useless (as gold and silver helmets would be) because every rank of
  nobility is distinguished by the coronet proper to his degree. Whatever
  honour may be attributed to the helmet, the use of it with the arms is
  but modern; and upon the coins of kings and sovereign princes, where they
  are chiefly to be met with, the helmets are barred, and either full or in
  profile, as best suited the occasion; and upon the Garter plates of
  Christian Duke of Brunswick (1625), Gustavus Adolphus King of Sweden
  (1628), and Charles Count Palatine of the Rhine (1633 and 1680), they are
  full fronted with seven barrs.</p>

  <p>"In Great Britain we have but four kinds of helmets, according to the
  four different degrees in the state&mdash;the king, the nobility,
  knights, and gentry. The sovereign helmet full fronted, having seven
  barrs or guards, visure without any bever; the nobilities the same, but
  half turned to the right, and usually showing four barrs; the knight's
  helmet full fronted, with the bever turned up; and the gentleman's in
  profile, the bever or visor close; using steel helmets for all as the
  only proper metal for a helmet common to all. Foreigners condemn us for
  attributing that helmet to a knight, which they give to a king; and more
  proper, says Mackensie, for a king without guard-visure than for a knight
  (<i>Science of Heraldry</i>, p.&nbsp;87.), because knights are in danger, and
  have less need to command. But it must be observed, the knight's helmet
  has a visor, and no barrs; the sovereign's barrs, because no visor. And
  this kind of helmet, with barrs instead of a visor, seems to have been
  contrived for princes and great commanders, who would have been
  incommoded by the visor, and too much exposed without anything, therefore
  had barrs: whereas knights being, according to Mackensie, in more danger
  and having less need to command, had their helmet for action; and are
  represented with the bever up, ready to receive the king or general's
  command. As to the resemblance of the one to the other, both being in
  full front, the connexion was not anciently so remote as seems at this
  day. Knighthood is the first and most ancient military honour, and
  therefore at this day sovereign princes and knights are the only two
  honours universally acknowledged. Knighthood is the source of all
  honours, and of all military glory, and an honour esteemed by and
  conferred upon kings; without which they were heretofore thought
  incomplete, and could not confer that honour on others, no more than
  ordination could be conferred by one unordained: so that there was a very
  near connexion between sovereignty and knighthood. And besides, the
  propriety of the open helmet with a visor for a knight, and the helmet
  guard-visure for a king, the latter is more ornamental, especially if,
  according to the modern practice, the barrs are gold. As the king's
  helmet is without a visor, and barred, so is that of the nobility in
  imitation of it, but turned to the right as a proper distinction as, in
  like manner, that of the gentry differs from the knights. As there are in
  fact but two orders of men, nobility of which the king is the first
  degree, and gentry of which knights are the first, so they are by this
  means sufficiently distinguished according to their respective orders and
  degrees: the first order distinguished by the barred helmet, the gentry
  by the visored helmet with proper differences of the second degrees of
  each class from the first; and all other distinctions more than this are
  unnecessary and useless.</p>

  <p>"The helmet does not seem to have been formerly used but in a military
  way, and affairs of chivalry. I do not find any helmets upon the
  monuments of our Kings of England, nor upon other ancient monuments, nor
  upon any of the Great Seals, coins, or medals. Upon the plates of the
  Knights of the Garter at Windsor, all degrees used the old profile close
  helmet till about 1588, some few excepted; and soon after, the helmet
  with barrs came into fashion, and was used for all degrees of nobility,
  and it has continued ever since; and the same has been used for all
  degrees of nobility upon the plates of the Knights of the Bath, those
  that are knights only using a knight's helmet. And the same may be
  observed in Sir Edward Walker's <i>Books of the Nobility from the
  Restoration to the Revolution</i>, wherein all degrees have the helmet
  turned towards the right, showing four barrs; the sovereign's being full
  with seven barrs."</p>

<h3>HAMPDEN'S DEATH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 495.)</p>

  <p>"On the 21st of July, 1828, the corpse of John Hampden was disinterred
  by the late Lord Nugent for the purpose of settling the disputed point of
  history as to the manner in which the patriot received his death-wound.
  The examination seems to have been conducted after a somewhat bungling
  fashion for a scientific object, and the facts disclosed were these: 'On
  lifting up the right arm we found that it was dispossessed of its hand.
  We might therefore naturally conjecture that it had been amputated, as
  the bone presented a perfectly flat appearance, as if sawn off by some
  sharp instrument. On searching under the cloths, to our no small
  astonishment we found the hand, or rather a number of small bones,
  inclosed in a separate cloth. For about six inches up the arm the flesh
  had wasted away, being evidently smaller than the lower part of the left
  arm, to which the hand was very firmly united, and which presented no
  symptoms of decay further than the two bones of the forefinger loose.
  Even the nails remained entire, of which we saw no appearance in the
  cloth containing the remains of the right hand.... The clavicle of the
  right shoulder was firmly united to the scapula, nor did there appear any
  contusion or indentation that evinced symptoms of any wound ever having
  been inflicted. The left shoulder, on the contrary, was smaller and
  sunken in, as if the clavicle had been displaced. To <!-- Page 647
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page647"></a>{647}</span>remove all
  doubts, it was adjudged necessary to remove the arms, which were
  amputated with a penknife (!). The socket of the left (<i>sic</i>) arm
  was perfectly white and healthy, and the clavicle firmly united to the
  scapula, nor was there the least appearance of contusion or wound. The
  socket of the right (<i>sic</i>) shoulder, on the contrary, was of a
  brownish cast, and the clavicle being found quite loose and disunited
  from the scapula, proved that dislocation had taken place. The bones,
  however, were quite perfect.' These appearances indicated that injuries
  had been received both in the hand and shoulder, the former justifying
  the belief in Sir Robert Pye's statement to the Harleys, that the pistol
  which had been presented to him by Sir Robert, his son-in-law, had burst
  and shattered his hand in a terrible manner at the action of Chalgrave
  Field; the latter indicating that he had either been wounded in the
  shoulder by a spent ball, or had received an injury there by falling from
  his horse after his hand was shattered. Of these wounds he died three or
  four days after, according to Sir Philip Warwick. According to Clarendon,
  'three weeks after being shot into the shoulder with a brace of bullets,
  which broke the bone.' The bone, however, was not found broken, and the
  'brace of bullets' is equally imaginary."</p>

<h3>PETER ALLAN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 539. 630.)</p>

  <p>Peter Allan deserves more than a brief notice. His history is so full
  of romance, the relics of his name and fame are so many, and he is withal
  so little known, that I presume I may on this occasion trespass on more
  than the ordinary space allotted to a "minor," but which should be a
  "major" Query.</p>

  <p>Peter Allan was born at Selkirk (?) in the year 1798. His parents were
  peasants, and Peter in early life became valet to Mr. Williamson, brother
  of Sir Hedworth Williamson. He afterwards became gamekeeper to the
  Marquis of Londonderry, and in that capacity acquired a reputation as an
  unerring shot, and a man of unusual physical strength and courage. He
  afterwards married, and became a publican at Whitburn, and in the course
  of few years purchased a little property, and occupied himself in the
  superintendence of dock works and stone quarries. In this latter capacity
  he acquired the skill in quarrying, on which his fame chiefly rests.
  Having a turn for a romantic life, he conceived the strange project of
  founding a colony at Marsden, a wild, rocky bay below the mouth of the
  Tyne, five miles from Sunderland, and three from South Shields. The spot
  chosen by Peter as his future home had been colonised some years before
  by one "Jack the Blaster," who had performed a series of excavations, and
  amongst them a huge round perforation from the high land above to the
  beach below, through which it is said many a cargo has passed ashore
  without being entered in the books of the excise. Here the cliff is
  formed of hard magnesian limestone, and rises perpendicularly from the
  beach more than a hundred feet. When Peter set to work, the only
  habitable portions were two wild caves opening to the sea, into which at
  high tide the breakers tumbled, and where during rough weather it was
  impossible to continue with safety. On the face of the rock Peter built a
  homestead of timber, and set up farm and tavern. In the rock itself he
  excavated fifteen rooms, to each of which he gave an appropriate name;
  the most interesting are the "Gaol Room," the "Devil's Chamber," the
  "Circular Room," the "Dining Room," and the "Ball Room." The height of
  the entire excavation is twenty feet, its breadth thirty, and its length,
  from the ball room to the cottage, one hundred and twenty. Several parts
  of the cave are lighted by windows hewn in the face of the rock, and
  these give the cave a picturesque appearance as viewed frown the beach
  below. In addition to these labours, Peter took possession of a huge
  table-rock, which stands some distance from the cliffs opposite to the
  grotto. By dint of extraordinary exertions he excavated a passage from
  the land side of this rock through its substance to the surface, and by
  placing scaling ladders against its face, made provision for ascent and
  descent at high water. The three-quarters of an acre of surface he
  colonised with rabbits, and built a shanty for himself and companions,
  where they dwelt for some time thinning the wild fowl with their deadly
  shots, and raising many an echo with their shouts of revelry.</p>

  <p>To describe the strange scene presented by the grotto itself, the
  farm-buildings on the face of the cliff, the huge table-rock and
  flagstaff, the many quaint blocks, pillars and wild escarpments, and the
  numerous domestic animals, such as mastiffs, pigs, ravens, and goats, all
  congregated together in a small bay, and literally separated from the
  world by the barren waste land above, and the huge cliffs and restless
  sea below, would be beyond the scope of "N. &amp; Q.," though it is worth
  a note in passing, that for the tourist a visit to Marsden would be
  highly remunerative.</p>

  <p>Peter Allan endured many hardships in his cave at Marsden. He was
  accused of smuggling, and annoyed by the excise. He and his family were
  once shut in for six weeks by the snow, during the whole of which time it
  was impossible for any human being to approach them. Yet in spite of many
  hardships, Peter reared in the grotto a family of eight children, three
  daughters and five sons, all of whom are living and prospering in the
  world. The grotto is still kept by his widow, his <!-- Page 648 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page648"></a>{648}</span>eldest son William, and
  one daughter, assisting Mrs. Allan in the management The son William is
  an experienced blaster, and occupies himself in excavations and
  improvements; the daughter, a brunette, is a first-rate shot, and a girl
  of extraordinary spirit and gaiety. She is the Grace Darling of the
  neighbourhood, and both her and her mother have saved many lives by their
  dexterity in boating and extraordinary courage. Peter himself was a bold,
  determined, and honest man, fond of a joke, and passionately devoted to
  bees, birds, pigs, and dogs, many of whom (pigs especially) used to
  follow him to Shields and Sunderland, when he went thither. After
  twenty-two years' possession of the caverns, the proprietor of the
  adjoining land served him with a process of ejectment; Peter refused to
  leave the habitation which he had formed by twenty years' unremitting
  toil, and which he had actually won from the sea, without encroachment on
  an inch of the mainland. After a tedious law-suit, judgment was given in
  his favour, but he had to pay costs. The anxieties of this lawsuit broke
  his heart, and he never recovered either health or spirits. He died on
  the 31st of August, 1849, in the 51st year of his age, leaving his wife
  and eight children to lament him. He was buried in Whitburn churchyard,
  and over his grave was placed a stone with the inscription:</p>

  neighbourhood of Marsden. Particulars of these and other matters touching
  this romantic history, may be obtained in No. 2. of <i>Summer Excursions

<h3>"COULD WE WITH INK," ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 127. 180. 422.)</p>

  <p>I think that your well-read correspondent <span class="sc">J.&nbsp;W.
  Thomas</span> will agree with me that the <i>bonâ fide</i> authorship of
  the beautiful lines alluded to must be ascertained, not by a single
  expression, but by the whole of the charming poem. The striking
  expression of Mohammed, quoted by <span class="sc">J.&nbsp;W. Thomas</span>,
  is quite common amongst the Easterns even at the present day. I remember,
  when at Malta, in March, 1848, whilst walking in company of the most
  accomplished Arabian of the day, the conversation turned upon a certain
  individual who had since acquired a most unenviable notoriety in the
  annals of British jurisprudence, my companion abruptly turned upon me,
  whilst at the shore of the Mediterranean, and said, in his fascinating
  Arabic, "Behold this great sea! were all its water turned into ink, it
  would be insufficient to describe the villany of the individual you speak
  of."</p>

  <p>Rabbi Mayir ben Isaac's poem corresponds not merely in a single
  expression, but in every one. The Chaldee hymn has the ink and ocean,
  parchment and heavens, stalks and quills, mankind and scribes, &amp;c.
  Pray do me the favour to insert the original lines. I assure you that
  they are well worthy of a place in "N. &amp; Q." Here they are:</p>

<h3>WHAT DAY IS IT AT OUR ANTIPODES?</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 102.)</p>

  <p>This question was asked by H., and at p. 479. an answer to it was
  undertaken by <span class="sc">Este</span>. But, probably from
  over-anxiety to be very brief, <span class="sc">Este</span> was betrayed
  into a most strange and unaccountable misstatement, which ought to be set
  right before the conclusion of the volume; since, if correctness be
  generally desirable in all communications to "N. &amp; Q.," it is
  absolutely indispensable in professed answers to required information.
  <span class="sc">Este</span> says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A person sailing to our Antipodes westward will lose twelve hours; by
  sailing thither eastward he will gain twelve hours."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is quite correct. But if one person lose twelve, and another gain
  twelve, the manifest difference between them is twenty-four; and yet
  <span class="sc">Este</span> goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If both meet together at the same hour, say eleven o'clock, the one
  will reckon 11 <span class="scac">A.M.</span>, the other 11 <span
  class="scac">P.M.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the misstatement. No two persons, by any correct system of
  reckoning, could arrive at a result which would imply a physical
  impossibility; and it is needless to say that the concurrence of <span
  class="scac">A.M</span>. and <span class="scac">P.M</span>. at the same
  time and place would come under that designation. What <span
  class="sc">Este</span> should have said is, that both persons meeting
  <!-- Page 649 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page649"></a>{649}</span>together on the same day, if it be
  reckoned Monday by the one, it will be reckoned Tuesday by the other.
  They may differ as to Monday or Tuesday, but they cannot rationally
  differ as to whether it is day or night.</p>

  <p>It may be added that, no matter where these two persons might meet,
  whether at the Antipodes or at any other place, still, upon comparing
  their journals, there would always appear a day's difference between
  them; and if they were to keep continually sailing on, one always towards
  the west, and the other always towards the east, every time they might
  meet or cross each other, they would increase the difference between them
  by an additional day.</p>

  <p>Whence it follows, that if two ships were to leave England on the same
  day, one sailing east by the Cape of Good Hope, and the other west by
  Cape Horn, returning home respectively by the opposite capes; and if both
  were to arrive again in England at the same time, there would be found in
  the reckoning of the eastern vessel two entire days more than in that of
  the western vessel. Nor would this difference be merely theoretic or
  imaginary; on the contrary, it would be a real and substantial gain on
  the part of the eastern vessel: her crew would have consumed two whole
  rations of breakfast, dinner, and supper, and swallowed two days'
  allowance of grog more than the other crew; and they would have enjoyed
  two nights more sleep.</p>

  <p>But all this is not an answer to H's question; what he wants to know
  is whether the day at the Antipodes is twelve hours in advance or in
  arrear of our day and, whichever it is, why is it?</p>

  <p>But here H. is not sufficiently explicit. His question relates to a
  practical fact, and therefore he should have been more particular in
  designating the exact habitable place to which it referred. Our
  Antipodes, strictly speaking, or rather the antipodal point to Greenwich
  Observatory, is 180° of east (or west) longitude, and 51° 28&prime;
  &amp;c. of south latitude. But this is not the only point that differs by
  exactly twelve hours in time from Greenwich; all places lying beneath the
  meridian of 180°, "our Periæci" as well as "our Antipodes," are similarly
  affected, and to them the same question would be applicable. H. is right,
  however, in assuming that, with respect to that meridian, the decision
  must be purely arbitrary. It is as though two men were to keep moving
  round a circle in the same direction, with the same speed, and at
  diametrically opposite points; it must be an arbitrary decision which
  would pronounce that either was in advance, or in arrear, of the
  other.</p>

  <p>Regarding, then, the meridian of 180° as the neutral point, the most
  rational system, so far as British settlements are concerned, is to
  reckon longitude both ways, from 0° to 180°, east and west from
  Greenwich; and to regard all west longitude as in arrear of British time,
  and all east longitude as in advance of it. And this is the method
  practised by modern navigators.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, in obedience to any preconceived system, but by
  pure accident, that our settlements in Australia and New Zealand happen
  to be in accordance with this rule. The last-named country is very close
  upon the verge of eastern longitude, but still it is within it, and its
  day is rightly in advance of our day. But the first settlers to Botany
  Bay, in 1788, were actually under orders to go out by Cape Horn, and were
  only forced by stress of weather to adopt the opposite course by the Cape
  of Good Hope. Had they kept to their prescribed route, there cannot be a
  doubt that the day of the week and month in Australia would now be a day
  later than it is.</p>

  <p>The best proof of the truth of this assertion is, that a few years
  afterwards a missionary expedition was sent out to Otaheite, with respect
  to which a precisely similar accident occurred; they could not weather
  Cape Horn, and were forced to go round, some twice the distance out of
  their way, by the Cape of Good Hope; consequently they carried with them
  what may be called the eastern day, and since then that is the day
  observed at Otaheite, although fully two hours within the western limit
  of longitude.</p>

  <p>From this cause an actual practical anomaly has recently arisen. The
  French authorities in Tahiti, in accordance with the before-mentioned
  rule, have arranged their day by <i>western longitude</i>; consequently,
  in addition to other points of dissent, they observe the Sabbath and
  other festivals one day later than the resident English missionaries.</p>

  <p>I have extended this explanation to a greater length than I intended,
  but the subject is interesting, and not generally well understood; to do
  it justice, therefore, is not compatible with brevity. Much of what I
  have said is doubtless already known to your readers; nevertheless I hope
  it may be useful in affording to H. the information he required, and to
  <span class="sc">Este</span> more fixed notions on the subject than he
  seems to have entertained when he wrote the answer referred to.</p>

  <p><i>On the Restoration of old Collodion.</i>&mdash;Many plans have been
  suggested for the restoration of collodion when it has lost its
  sensitiveness by age. In the last Number of the <i>Photographic
  Journal</i>, p.&nbsp;147., <span class="sc">Mr. Crookes</span> proposes "to
  remove the free iodine from the collodion by means of a piece of pure
  silver. For two ounces of liquid I should recommend a sheet of stout
  silver foil, about two inches long and half an inch broad. It will
  require to remain in contact with the collodion for about two days, or
  even longer if the latter be very dark-coloured; and in this case it will
  sometimes be found advantageous to clean the surface of the silver, as it
  becomes protected with a coating of iodide, by means of cyanide of
  potassium or hyposulphite of soda.</p>

  <p>"When thus renovated, the collodion will be found as sensitive and
  good as it was originally."</p>

  <p>This plan is certainly more simple than any that has yet been
  recommended. The action of the silver being its mere combination with the
  free iodine, thereby producing the reduction of the collodion to its
  original colourless condition, I would venture to put this question to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Crookes</span> (to whom the readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  are already under great obligations): Does he consider that it is the
  mere presence of free iodine which causes the want of sensitiveness in
  the collodion? This is all which appears to be accomplished by the
  process which Mr. Crookes recommends.</p>

  <p>Now, as one who has had some experience, both in the manufacture and
  uses of collodion, such a view does not agree with my practice and
  observation. Occasionally, upon sensitising collodion, I have found it
  assume a deep sherry colour a few hours after being made. This must have
  depended upon the free iodide it contained, and yet such collodion has
  worked most admirably. I have now before me a large body of collodion
  almost red, and which has been made some three or four months; yet the
  last time I used this, about a week since, it was just as good as when it
  was first made. Undoubtedly collodion does more or less deteriorate with
  age; but here I would observe, that there is an immense difference in the
  different manufactures of collodion, and which can be ascertained by use
  only, and not by appearance.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Hennah, who has had much practical experience, recommends the
  collodion to be made sensitive merely by the iodide of potassium; and he
  said, "if it did not work quite clearly and well, a little tincture of
  iodine brought it right." Here, then, is added the very thing which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Crookes</span> proposes to abstract.</p>

  <p>Again, <span class="sc">Mr. Crookes</span> considers the free iodine
  to be the cause of the colouring of the collodion; will he then kindly
  explain its <i>modus operandi</i>?</p>

  <p>As he has on several occasions given your readers the benefit of his
  great chemical knowledge, I trust they may be favoured by him with a
  solution of these difficulties, which have puzzled</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Britain</i> (Vol. viii., p. 344.).&mdash;Since my
  last reference to this matter (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;445.) I find that the

  an oriental scholar and French protestant divine in the first half of the

  <p><i>Ladies' Arms borne in a Lozenge</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 37. 83. 277.

  known to all heralds, though coach-painters and silversmiths do not <!--
  Page 653 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page653"></a>{653}</span>always sufficiently describe it. If <span
  class="sc">Broctuna</span>, however, be a <i>practical</i> herald, he
  must often have experienced the difficulty of placing impalements or
  quarterings correctly, even on a lozenge. On the long and narrow fusil it
  would be impossible. When the fusil, instead of being a mere heraldic
  bearing, has to be used as the shape of a shield for the actual use of
  the painter or engraver, it must of necessity be widened into the
  lozenge; and as the latter is probably only the same distaff with little
  more wool upon it, there seems no objection to the arrangement. <span
  class="sc">Broctuna</span> is too good an antiquary not to know on
  recollection that the "vyings of widows" had little to do with funeral
  arrangements in those days. Procrustes, the herald, came down at all
  great funerals, and regulated everything with just so much pomp, and no
  more, as the precise rank of the deceased entitled him to.</p>

  objection to his theory.</p>

  "Whence, or when, originated the application of Abigail, as applied to a

  occurs to me that it may have been derived from the notorious Abigail
  Hill, better known as Mrs. Masham, a poor relative of Sarah Duchess of
  Marlborough, and by her introduced to a subordinate place about the
  person of Queen Anne. She rapidly acquired sufficient influence to
  supplant her benefactress. The intrigues of the Tory party received
  sufficient furtherance from this bedchamber official to effect ultimately
  the downfall of the Whig ministry; and the use of the term by Dean Swift,
  of which your original Querist <span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span> speaks,
  would suffice to give currency and to associate the name of so famous an
  <i>intriguante</i> with the office which she filled. It must be matter of
  opinion whether the Dean (as <span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> thinks)
  employed the term as <i>not new in those</i> days, or as one which had
  <i>taken</i> so rapidly in the current conversation of the day, as to
  require but his putting it in print to establish it in its new sense so
  long as the language shall be spoken or written.</p>

  <p><i>The Arms of Richard, King of the Romans</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 265.
  454.). With every respect for such heraldic authorities as <span
  class="sc">Mr. Gough</span> and <span class="sc">Mr. Lover</span>, I
  think the question as to whether the so-called bezants in the arms of
  Richard, King of the Romans, referred to his earldom of Poictou or of
  Cornwall, inclines in favour of the former: for instance, in 1253 he
  granted to the <!-- Page 654 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page654"></a>{654}</span>monks of Okebury a release of suit and
  service within his manor of Wallingford, which charter has a seal
  appended bearing an impress of the earl armed on horseback, with a
  <i>lion rampant crowned</i> on his surcoat, inscribed "Sigillum Richardi
  Comitis Cornubiæ." Now this inscription seems to identify the lion as
  pertaining to the earldom of Cornwall; surely, if the bezants represented
  this earldom, they would not have been omitted on his seal as <i>Comes
  Cornubiæ</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, a very high heraldic authority, one of deep research, Mr. J.&nbsp;R.
  Planché, gives this opinion on the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The border bezantée, or talentée, of Richard, King of the Romans, is
  no representation of coins but of peas (<i>poix</i>), being the arms of
  Poitiers or Poictou (Menestrier, <i>Orig.</i>, p.&nbsp;147.), of which he was
  earl, and not of his other earldom of Cornwall, as imagined by Sandford
  and others. The adoption of bezants as the arms of Cornwall, and by so
  many Cornish families on that account, are all subsequent assumptions
  derived from the arms of Earl Richard aforesaid, the peas having been
  promoted into bezants by being gilt, and become identified with the
  Cornish escutcheon as the garbs of Blundeville are with that of Chester,
  or the coat of Cantelupe with that of the see of Hereford."&mdash;<i>The
  Pursuivant at Arms</i>, p.&nbsp;136.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A simple Query then would seem to settle this matter. Is any instance
  known of bezants occurring as the arms of Cornell previous to the time of
  Earl Richard, or earlier than the commencement of the thirteenth
  century?</p>

  <p><i>Greek and Roman Fortifications</i> (Vol. viii., p.

  Fosbroke's <i>Grecian and Roman Antiquities</i> (Longman, 1833).</p>

  <p><i>Osbernus filius Herfasti</i> (Vol. viii., p. 515.).&mdash;In reply
  to the Query of <span class="sc">Mr. Sansom</span>, "Whether Osborn de
  Crespon, the brother of the Duchess of Normandy, had a brother of the
  same name?" I beg to reply that there appears to be distinct evidence
  that he had; for in a grant of lands by Richard II., Duke of Normandy,
  who died in 1026, to the monks of St. Michael, there are, along with the
  signatures of his son Richard and several other witnesses, those of
  <i>Osbernus frater Comitissæ</i>, and <i>Osbernus filius Arfast</i>
  (<i>Lobineau</i>, tom. ii. p.&nbsp;97.). One of those may probably have become
  Abbot of S. Evroult. No doubt <span class="sc">Mr. Sansom</span> is well
  aware that one of the same family was Osborn, Bishop of Exeter. He was a
  son of Osborn de Crespon, and brother of the Earl of Hereford, premier
  peer of England. In 1066 he forbad the monks to be buried in the
  cloisters of their monasteries; but they resisted his injunction, and, on
  an appeal to the Pope, obtained a decision against him (<i>Mabillon</i>).
  For an eulogium on him see Godwin, <i>De presul. Angl</i>. He died in
  1104, and was buried in the cathedral at Exeter.</p>

  <p>I would observe that the ancient orthography of the name is Osbern,
  which was continued for many centuries, and may even now be seen in
  Maidwell Church, Northamptonshire, on the monument of Lady Gorges, the
  daughter of Sir John Osbern, who died in 1633.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Omicron</span>.</p>

  <p>I think there can be little doubt that Herfastus "the Dane" was the
  father of Gunnora, wife of Rich. I., Duke of Normandy; of Aveline, wife
  of Osbernus de Bolebec, Lord of Bolbec and Count of Longueville; and of
  Weira, wife of Turolf de Pont Audomere. The brother of these three
  sisters was another Herfastus, Abbot of St. Evrau; who was the father of
  Osbernus de Crepon, Steward of the Household, and Sewer to the
  Conqueror.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. C.</p>

  <p><i>Devonianisms</i> (Vol. viii., p. 65.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Mr. Keys</span> is at a loss for the origin of the word
  <i>plum</i>, as used in Devonshire. Surely it is the same word as
  <i>plump</i>, although employed in a somewhat different sense.
  <i>Plum</i> or <i>plump</i>, as applied to a bed, would certainly convey
  the idea of softness or downiness. As to the employment of the word as a
  verb, I conceive that it is analogous to an expression which I have often
  heard used by cooks, in speaking of meat or poultry, "to plump up." A
  cook will say of a fowl which appears deficient in flesh, "It is a young
  bird; it will plump up when it comes to the fire." A native of Devonshire
  would simply say, "It will plum."</p>

  <p>As to the word <i>clunk</i>, it is in use throughout Cornwall in the
  sense of "to swallow," and is undoubtedly Celtic. On referring to Le
  Gonidec's <i>Dictionnaire Celto-Breton</i>, I find "<i>Lonka</i>, or
  <i>Lounka</i>, v.a. <i>avaler</i>."</p>

  <p>I have neither a Welsh dictionary nor one of the ancient Cornish
  language at hand, but I have no doubt that the same word, with the same
  signification, will be found in both those dialects of the Celtic,
  probably with some difference of spelling, which would bring it nearer to
  the word <i>clunk</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not wonderful that a word, the sound of which is so expressive
  of the action, should have continued in use among an illiterate peasantry
  long after the language from which it is derived was forgotten; but many
  pure Celtic words, which have not this recommendation, are still in
  common use in Cornwall, and a collection of them would be highly
  interesting. Could not some of your antiquarian correspondents in the
  west, <span class="sc">Mr. Boase</span> of Penzance for example, furnish
  such a list? I will mention one or two words which I chance to remember:
  <i>mabyer</i>, a chicken, Breton <i>mab</i>, a son, <i>iar</i>, a hen;
  <i>vean</i>, little, Breton <i>vihan</i>. <!-- Page 655 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page655"></a>{655}</span></p>

  <p>To persons acquainted with the Welsh or Breton, the names of places in
  Cornwall, though sometimes strangely corrupted, are almost all
  significant. The dialect of Celtic spoken in Cornwall appears to have
  approached more closely to the latter than to the former of these
  tongues; or perhaps, speaking more correctly, it formed a connecting link
  between them, as Cornwall itself lies about midway between Wales and
  Brittany.</p>

  <p><i>Gentile Names of the Jews</i> (Vol. viii., p. 563.).&mdash;The
  names of Rothschild, Montefiore, and Davis are family names, and not
  <i>noms de guerre</i>.</p>

  <p>It is possible that the honoured names of Rothschild and Montefiore
  date from a purchase by some one of their ancestry of <i>Gentile castles
  or lands</i>, and with it the purchase right of name.</p>

  <p>Davis is legitimately Jewish, but probably the Gentile name of Davis
  cannot boast of its pure source, and no doubt where Gentile pedigree
  loses trace, Jewish descent commences, either by a left-handed Jew
  connexion with a Gentile fair one, or a renegade ancestry.</p>

  <p><i>Longevity</i> (Vol. viii., p. 113.).&mdash;On October 15, Judy, a
  slave, died on the plantation of Edmund B. Richardson, in Bladen county,
  North Carolina, aged 110 years. She was one of eight slaves who nearly
  sixty years ago were the first settlers on the plantation, where she
  died. Of the seven others, one died over 90 years of age, another 93, and
  a third 81; two are living, one 75 and the other over 60 years of
  age.</p>

  <p>Within five miles of the place where Judy died, William Pridgen lived,
  who died about five years ago, aged 122 years.</p>

  <p>David Kennison, a soldier of the Revolution, died near Albany (N.&nbsp;Y.)

  <p><i>Reversible Names</i> (Vol. viii., p. 244.).&mdash;Emme might have
  been added to your correspondent's list, a female name which, when first
  known in England, was spelt as above written, and not Emma, as at the
  present time. In an old book I have seen the name and its meaning thus
  recorded,&mdash;in English, <i>Emme</i>; in French, <i>Emme, bonne
  nourrice</i>.</p>

  <p>I must beg to differ in opinion from your correspondent, even with his
  epicene restriction, who states "that <i>varium et mutabile semper
  femina</i> only means that whatever reads backwards and forwards, the
  same is <i>always feminine</i>."</p>

  <p>If M. will take the trouble to look in Boyle's <i>Court Guide</i> for
  1845, p. 358., he will find the name of a late very distinguished general
  officer, Sir Burges Camac. A wealthy branch of this family is now
  established in the United States, and one of its members bears the name
  of Camac Camac.</p>

  <p>I am unable to give M. another instance, and doubt if one can be
  easily found where the Christian and surnames of a gentleman are alike,
  and both reversible.</p>

  forward, you will, perhaps, allow me to transcribe the following

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p><i>The History of Millwall, commonly called the Isle of Dogs,
  including Notices of the West India Docks and City Canal, and Notes on
  Poplar, Blackwall, Limehouse,</i> <!-- Page 656 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page656"></a>{656}</span><i>and Stepney</i>, by
  B.&nbsp;H. Cowper, is unquestionably one of the most carefully compiled, and
  judiciously arranged, little topographical works, which we have ever been
  called upon to notice. The intelligent M.P. who is recorded to have asked
  a witness before a select committee for the <i>precise</i> locality of
  the Isle of Dogs, and to have been satisfied with the answer "Between
  London Bridge and Gravesend," may, if inclined to pursue his inquiries,
  find its history told most fully and most agreeably in the little volume
  now before us.</p>

  <p>In our Number for the 21st of May last, we called attention to, and
  spoke in terms of fitting approbation of, the First Part of <i>The
  English Bible</i>; containing the Old and New Testaments, according to
  the authorised version; newly divided into paragraphs, with concise
  Introductions to the several Books, and with Maps and Notes illustrative
  of the Chronology, History, and Geography of the Holy Scriptures;
  containing also the most remarkable variations of the Ancient Versions,
  and the chief results of Modern Criticism. Part II., comprising
  <i>Exodus</i> and <i>Leviticus</i>, is now before us, and exhibits the
  same merits as its predecessor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Miller, of Chandos Street, who during the past year added to the
  value of the Monthly Catalogues by the addition to each of them of
  several pages of literary and bibliographical miscellanies, has just
  collected these into a little volume, under the title of <i>Fly Leaves,
  or Scraps and Sketches, Literary, Bibliographical, and Miscellaneous</i>,
  which may find a fitting place beside Davis's <i>Olio</i>, and other
  works of that class.</p>

  <p>We regret to learn, as we do from the <i>Literary Gazette</i> of
  Saturday last, that the Trustees of the British Museum, in defiance of
  the earnest recommendation of the Society of Antiquaries and of the
  Archæological Institute, and with a total disregard of the feelings and
  opinions of those best qualified to advise them upon the subject, have
  declined to purchase the Faussett Collection of Early Antiquities, and
  consequently will lose the Fairford Collection offered to them as a free
  gift by Mr. Wylie: so that the enlightened foreigner, who visits this
  great national establishment, and admiring its noble collections of
  Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Assyrian antiquities, asks, "but where are
  your own national antiquities?" must still be answered, "We have not got
  one!" They certainly do manage these things better in France and
  Denmark.</p>

  <p>Our readers, we have no doubt, shared the regret with which we read
  the advertisement in our columns last week from the Rev. Dr. Hincks, who,
  from the want of encouragement, and in the face of peculiarly adverse
  circumstances, is compelled to withdraw from the field of Assyrian
  discovery; and who is advertising for some competent person who will work
  out what he has in progress. Although Assyrian literature may at present
  be discouraged by the Church and neglected by the Universities, there can
  be little doubt that it must ere long assume a very different position:
  and we therefore trust that some means may yet be taken to prevent Dr.
  Hincks' withdrawal from a field of study in which he has been so
  successful.</p>

  <p>As we have deviated from our usual course in noticing subjects
  advertised in our pages, we take the opportunity of calling the attention
  of our antiquarian friends to the advertisement from the Rev. G. Cumming
  on the subject of the casts now making from the Runic Monuments in the
  Isle of Man.</p>
